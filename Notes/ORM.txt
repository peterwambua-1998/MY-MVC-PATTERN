ORM
------------------------------------------
- Object Relational Mapping 
- its a layer that sits between your application and storage layer like database
- formal definition of ORM
    its a technique of converting data between incompatible type systems using OOP

- ORM simply lets us map database records with the relationships for eg to class objects
- There are several patterns when it comes to ORM
- two of the most common patterns are:
    1. Active record - eg: laravel eloquent
    2. Data mapper - eg: doctraine used by Symfony

DATA MAPPER 
------------------------------------------
- Its a layer that simplifies data transfer between in memory objects and persistent storage like
  database
- This allows for the persistent layer to be decoupled isolated from the business logic
- In doctraine ORM the mapping can be done via attributes, annotations, config files or php mappers
